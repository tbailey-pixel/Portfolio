            This is a photograph taken at the Connellsville Railroads. A worker
            would use this bridge to get down to the tracks, featuring a sign telling them
            to Have a Safe Day. This picture is meant to encapsulate the history
            of Connellsville and its railroads, marking its time in the coke
            production industry.

            Balancing aperture, shutter speed and ISO to capture high impact
            moments during the game. These photos would be used to promote their
            team on social media, which has seen an increase in followers and
            engagement.

          <p class="info">
            A lot of people can relate to struggling to sleep some nights. Lying
            awake on your phone or just staring at the ceiling. I create this
            image to capture the dread and out of body experience this can
            sometimes create. Using a long exposure camera, I laid as still as I could but not enough to keep me from being blured.
